    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Learn how to deep-fry turkey for Thanksgiving without all the fuss. This deep-fried turkey recipe is simple — no injecting, no marinades, no complicated rubs. If you like a more traditional tasting turkey, this is the one for you!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ gallons peanut oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat oil in a large stockpot or turkey fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure the fryer is located outdoors in a safe area, preferably on dirt or pavement, and far away from buildings, wooden decks, or other objects. Keep a fire extinguisher handy, just in case.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the turkey is completely thawed. Cut any extra skin away from the neck area and make sure neck hole is at least 1 inch in diameter.</li>
        <li>Pat the bird completely dry with paper towels, then rub liberally with salt and pepper on both the outside and the inside.</li>
        <li>Place turkey into a drain basket, neck-side first. Working slowly and carefully, gently lower the basket into the hot oil to completely cover the turkey.</li>
        <li>Maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and cook turkey for 3 1/2 minutes per pound, about 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove basket from oil, and drain turkey. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; the internal temperature must be 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ul>
